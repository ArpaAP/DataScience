It is tailored for sampling at random with replacement from a categorical distribution and returns the proportions of sampled elements in each category.\n","\n","The `sample_proportions` function takes two arguments:\n","- the sample size\n","- the distribution of the categories in the population, as a list or array of proportions that add up to 1\n","\n","It returns an array containing the distribution of the categories in a random sample of the given size taken from the population. That's an array consisting of the sample proportions in all the different categories, in the same order in which they appeared in the population distribution.\n","\n","For example, suppose each plant of a species is red-flowering with chance 25%, pink-flowering with chance 50%, and white-flowering with chance 25%, regardless of the flower colors of all other plants. You can use `sample_proportions` to see the proportions of the different colors among 300 plants of the species."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":87,"metadata":{"id":"QrR2Qi1gN-OU","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742869964420,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"김진욱 (토이젠)","userId":"01411997590264032911"}},"outputId":"436847ee-9d16-4cf2-f559-37f72b2db9f0"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([ 0.29,  0.55,  0.16])"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":87}],"source":["# Species distribution of flower colors:\n","# Proportions are in the order Red, Pink, White\n","species_proportions = [0.25, 0.5, .25]\n","#species_proportions = [0.2, 0.8]\n","\n","sample_size = 100\n","\n","# Distribution of sample\n","sample_distribution = sample_proportions(sample_size, species_proportions)\n","sample_distribution"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hnXOJKERN-OU"},"source":["As you expect, the proportions in the sample sum to 1."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":88,"metadata":{"id":"FIPKijY0N-OV","outputId":"e2328b10-a503-465f-f5b8-315a820d3d67","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742869976797,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":37,"user":{"displayName":"김진욱 (토이젠)","userId":"01411997590264032911"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1.0"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":88}],"source":["sum(sample_distribution)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qHXalQRAN-OV"},"source":["The categories in `species_proportions` are in the order Red, Pink, White.
